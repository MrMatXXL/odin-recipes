    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Poutine is a popular Canadian dish that consists of crispy French fries topped with fresh cheese curds and
        smothered in rich, brown gravy. The fries provide a crunchy base, while the cheese curds add a slightly squeaky
        texture that melts slightly under the heat. The warm, savory gravy ties everything together, creating a
        deliciously comforting and indulgent meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fries</li>
        <li>Gravy</li>
        <li>Cheese curds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot or deep fryer to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Add the fries in small batches to avoid overcrowding the pot. Fry until golden and crispy, about 5 to 7
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the fries on paper towels and season them immediately with salt.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and stir well to create a roux, cooking for about 2 minutes until it’s lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook
            until the gravy thickens, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>If using, add the Worcestershire sauce for extra flavor. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Place the hot fries on a serving plate.</li>
        <li>Scatter the cheese curds evenly over the fries.</li>
        <li>Pour the hot gravy over the fries and cheese curds, allowing the cheese to soften slightly under the heat.
        </li>
    </ol>
